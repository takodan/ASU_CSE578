# Module 3: Multivariate Analysis


### Learning Objectives
1. Describe attributes of multivariate data visualization
2. Apply methods of visualizing discrete data values along two axes
3. Identify issues associated with parallel coordinate plots
4. Compare correlation and covariance
5. Define supervised learning and describe supervised learning methods
6. Describe methods for evaluating supervised learning
7. Define unsupervised learning and describe unsupervised learning methods
8. Describe methods for evaluating unsupervised learning


## Multivariate Analysis
1. To analyze data from more than one variable
2. Curse of dimensionality: the more dimensions in a visualization, the less effective standard computational and statistical techniques become.
3. Tools
    1. tables
        1. used to look individual value
        2. used to compare individual value
        3. precise value are required
    2. graphs
        1. the message is contained in the shape of the values
        2. used to reveal relationship among values

### Scatter Plots
