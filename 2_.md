Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Exploratory data analysis elements
    1. data visualzation
    2. residual殘差 analysis (殘差觀測值與統計量的估計值之間的差值)
    3. data transformations/ re-expression表達
    4. resistance procedures
2. Data distribution
    1. Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
    2. Mean
    3. Standard Deviation
    4. Skewness偏態(偏度)
3. Chart Types
    1. Pie Charts
        1. for comparing parts of a whole
        2. each slice represent a different category; arc length and area are important
        3. 7~9 categories maximum
        4. often lead to an overestimation of small value and underestimation large one
        5. hard to estimation actual value (should be presented with value)
        6. variant: doughnut charts
    2. Bar and Line Charts
        1. for comparing between groups (bar) or over time (line)
        2. bar chars are primarily used for for data that has value (quantitative data)
        3. graph aspect ratios (width/height) heavily influence perception of trends and patterns
        4. minimizing visual distortion (banking to 45°) by Cleveland
            1. suggests adjusting the chart's aspect ratio so that the average slope of the data trends approaches 45 degrees
            2. If a chart is too flat, the trend may be underestimated; if it is too steep, the trend may be exaggerated.
    3. Histograms
        1. represents the distribution of continuous data
        2. each bar represents a range of values (bins)
        3. have no gaps between bars (unlike bar graph)
        4. choosing the number of bins
            1. Sturges' Rule
                1. k = 1 + log2(n)
            2. Scott's Normal Reference Rule
                1. h = (3.5 * σ) / (n^(1/3))
                    1. h is the bin width (not the number of bins)
                    2. σ is the standard deviation of the data
                    3. n is the number of data points
            3. Freedman-Diaconis Rule
                1. h = (2 * IQR) / (n^(1/3))
                    1. h is the bin width
                    2. IQR is the interquartile range (Q3 - Q1)
                    3. n is the number of data points
            4. Square Root Rule
                1. k = sqrt(n)
        4. Box plots
        5. Q-Q plots
4. Quantile分位數
